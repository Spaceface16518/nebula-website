title: Nebula Web Project Lead Role Description
description: Description of Nebula Web project lead responsibilities
---

## Overview

Project Nebula is an initiative to build tools that help students. The Nebula Web App is the flagship product for Project Nebula. It is a tool for helping students plan their degree plans and general college experience.

## What We Need

A project lead for Project Nebula is both a project manager and active developer for the Nebula Data Service. We’re looking for someone with:

- An understanding of libraries, frameworks, and tools used to build modern software
- Experience building reactive websites using third-party data sources

Additionally, the following would be useful:

- Experience building progressive web applications
- Knowledge of how degree planning works at UTD

We’re all students, so we understand that someone won’t be an expert in anything. If you don’t have all the skills, you will most certainly learn as a part of the Project Nebula team!

## What You'll Do

Your general responsibilities would be:

- Ensuring the Nebula Web App is accessible at all times
- Managing the Nebula Web team (three other people)
- Keeping in touch with the Engineering Lead
- Taking feedback and working with your project’s community liaison to optimize feature development
- Working with the Head of Design to keep the data service in line with the rest of Project Nebula’s brand
- Working with the Head of Product to prioritize feature development

On a day-to-day basis, you would:

- Oversee the development of the Nebula Web App and take responsibility for features being built
- Keep in touch with the rest of your team to monitor project progress
- Program and implement solutions to issues on GitHub
- Review pull requests for code contributions from internal and external contributors

Expect to spend 5 hours per week on this role.

## What You'll Learn

As a project lead for the Nebula Web App, you’ll primarily learn how to manage a team of multiple people and communicate complex product needs to your team and the outside world. You will also learn much more about the intricacies of degree planning at UTD.

Specifically, you’ll learn:

- How to delegate responsibilities to a team
- How to prioritize features to build for projects
- How to use common cloud-based tools
- How to communicate technical issues to non-technical audiences
- What agile software development practices are
- How to provide useful, actionable feedback and mentorship to others

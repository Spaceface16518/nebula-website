title: 'Project Governance'

## Structure

Project Nebula is led by the Project Nebula Lead who has ultimate discretion
over the roadmap and features of all its parts.

Constitutent projects each have their own dedicated lead, who serves as a point
of contact and oversees development.

General user experience design is crafted by the User Experience Lead. Each
project may have its own user experience lead.

The chain of command currently looks like this:

- President of ACM
  - ACM Director of Development
    - Project Nebula Lead
      - Project Nebula User Experience Lead
      - Nebula Web Lead
      - Nebula Data Service Lead
      - UTD Survival Guide Lead

For the moment, the ACM Director of Development and Project Nebula Lead happen
to be the same person.

## The Role of ACM

The Development team of the UT Dallas chapter of the
[Association for Computing Machinery](https://acmutd.co) currently maintains
hosting and other infrastructure for all Project Nebula components.

The Director of Development reports to the ACM executives - president and vice
president - and has sole but limited authority in the following domains:

- Infrastucture choices (due to finance constraints or otherwise)
- Anything ACM-related (advertising Project Nebula from ACM's end)

The Project Nebula lead must abide by the polices for community projects set by
the Director of Development. ACM's media team is independent from Project
Nebula's designers.

## Maintainers

A Project Nebula maintainer is someone who monitors at least one project
and is responsible for maintaining its codebase, responding to issues,
performing code review for pull requests, fixing bugs, and developing or designing
new features when needed.

Maintainers are expected to serve as advocates for the project and respond to
general inquiries from users for contributors.

## Contributors

A contributor is anyone who contributes code or some other IP to a project under
Project Nebula. All Project Nebula maintainers are contributors.

All contributors are expected to act according to the Project's
[Code of Conduct](/docs/code-of-conduct).

## Structure

Project Nebula is led by the Head of Project Nebula who has ultimate discretion
over the group's roadmap and features for all its projects. Individual projects
each have their own dedicated lead who serves as a point of contact and oversees
development for that respective project.

Project Nebula's leadership is made of roles with different backgrounds who
oversee and assist with different aspects of development:

- Head of Project Nebula
- Head of Product
- Head of Engineering
- Head of Design
- Head of Marketing and Outreach
- Project Lead, Nebula Planner
- Project Lead, UTD Survival Guide
- Project Lead, API & Platform
- UI/UX Designer
- Product Deigner
- Community Liasion

Leadership consists of an Executive Committee made of:

- Head of Project Nebula
- Head of Product
- Head of Engineering
- Head of Design

This Executive Committee makes decisions on project governance and oversees
recruitment and partnerships with other external groups.

## Maintainer Responsibilities

A Project Nebula maintainer is someone who monitors at least one project
and is responsible for maintaining its codebase, responding to issues,
performing code review for pull requests, fixing bugs, and developing or
designing new features when needed.

Each maintainer chooses which projects they contribute to. Project Leads are
responsible for coordinating project timelines and being the ultimate
maintainers for the projects they oversee. Any maintainer may propose an idea
for a new project or tool maintained by Project Nebula by proposing it to the
Head of Product.

## Contributors

A contributor is anyone who contributes code or some other IP to a project under
Project Nebula. All Project Nebula maintainers are contributors.

All contributors are expected to act according to the Project's
[Code of Conduct](docs/about/code-of-conduct).

## The Role of ACM

The Engineering team of the UT Dallas chapter of the
[Association for Computing Machinery](https://acmutd.co) currently provides
hosting and other infrastructure for all Project Nebula components.

The Director of Engineering reports to the ACM executives - president and vice
president - and has sole but limited authority in the following domains:

- Infrastucture choices (due to finance constraints or otherwise)
- Anything ACM-related (advertising Project Nebula from ACM's end)

The Project Nebula lead must abide by the polices for community projects set by
the Director of Engineering. ACM's media team is independent from Project
Nebula's designers.

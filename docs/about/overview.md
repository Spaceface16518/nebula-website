Project Nebula is an initiative to build tools that help students at The
University of Texas at Dallas. We're a community of student developers and
designers who make college life easier through projects.

This website contains information about what projects are a part of Project
Nebula along with how it is organized. It also contains documentation for
[maintainers](docs/maintainers/overview) on how to contribute, including theming

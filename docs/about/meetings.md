description: Project Nebula is a decentralized group of contributors who meet regularly to catch up and discuss roadblocks. See when our maintainers for each of our projects meet, and feel free to drop in!

Project Nebula is a distributed collection of open source initiatives primarily
operated from The University of Texas at Dallas main campus.

All meetings are open to the public unless otherwise noted, so feel free to drop
in and get involved!

The simplest way to get involved is through Project Nebula Weekly Stand-up
meetings, which are co-hosted during Coding Hangouts on Wednesdays at 7 PM in
[SSA 12.471][hangouts room].

If you need assistance, contact head@utdnebula.com.

title: Community Liason
description: Description of Nebula Labs community liason responsibilities
---

## Overview

Nebula Labs is an initiative to build tools that help students. Keeping in touch with other students is an important part of that! A community liaison serves as a bridge from the wider community to Nebula Labs’s developers by talking to other students.

## What We Need

A community liaison will need to be someone willing to talk to people and make connections with students of all majors to understand their needs.

- We’re looking for someone with the following:
- Passion for helping students and understanding what issues they regularly face
- A genuine investment in students’ well-being
- Values a diversity of perspectives and is able to acknowledge and reach out to underrepresented groups
- Able to take away meaningful conclusions from 1-on-1 student interactions for the benefit of the greater student body

Any of these would additionally help:

- Having a well-sized social media presence
- Experience organizing events
- Experience with social media outreach
- Email etiquette
- Qualitative research skills
- Knowing a lot of people

We’re all students, so we understand that someone won’t be an expert in anything. If you don’t have all the skills, you will most certainly learn as a part of the Nebula Labs team!

## What You'll Do

As a community liaison, you’ll keep in touch with people outside of the Nebula Labs team. You’ll act as a representative for Nebula Labs and stay engaged with what’s going on in the student body.

Responsibilities:

- Informing project teams about student issues
- Hosting small-scale meet-ups or public events to engage with the community
- Reaching out to other student organizations to find unique opportunities for collaboration

What you’ll do on a regular basis:

- Have conversations with students (mostly virtually, but also offline)
- Keep track of what issues are most important to students
- Informally poll the UT Dallas community
- Advocate for Nebula Labs in relevant online community spaces (for example, sharing links to the UTD Survival Guide on Reddit in a non-spammy way)

Expect to spend 2-3 hours/week in this role.

## What You'll Learn

You’ll primarily get experience doing community outreach and effectively communicating stakeholders’ concerns. You’ll learn how to work with technical stakeholders and communicate the needs of a layperson to others on a team.

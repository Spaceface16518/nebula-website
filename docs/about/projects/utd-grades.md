UTD Grades is a tool that lets students view historical grade distributions
from previously taught class sections.

Thousands of students use UTD Grades as a rough approximation for the difficulty
of a class and to plan their academic coursework.

UTD Grades is a joint collaboration between Project Nebula maintainers and the
[Mercury](https://utdmercury.com), the student-run newspaper of UT Dalllas. To
obtain the historical grades data, the Mercury submits a Freedom of Information
Act request shortly after a semester ends, and then Project Nebula uploads that
data to the UTD Grades database.

You can access UTD Grades [here](https://grades.utdnebula.com) or at
[utdgrades.com](https://utdgrades.com).

## History

UTD Grades was created by [Bharat Arimilli](https://www.arimilli.io/), former
web editor for the Mercury, based off a concept by [UNT Grades](https://untgrades.com/),
a website built by [Jeffrey Wang](https://jeffw.xyz/) while he was a student the
Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science at the University of North Texas. The
project was built as a part of [ACM UTD's](https://acmutd.co) Labs initiative
and maintained by its team. In summer 2021, UTD Grades became a Project Nebula
project to give it better focus.

In fall 2021, Project Nebula announced that UTD Grades would get an upgrade due
for spring 2022. This upgrade would revamp the interface to provide more
information to students.

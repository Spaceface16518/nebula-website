Contributing to Project Nebula is simple. All of our codebases use a consistent
process to suggest or implement changes.

Addiitonally, many of our projects use a consistent technology stack and similar
tools.

The process generally looks like one of the following:

- Product/design (new features)
  - Open an discussion on GitHub
  - Open an issue on GitHub
- Code
  - Open an issue on GitHub
  - Open a pull request on GitHub
- Other
  - Send an email to core-maintainers@utdnebula.com

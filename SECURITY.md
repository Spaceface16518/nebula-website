# Project Nebula Security Policy

This security policy documents how to record a security vulnerability for the
Project Nebula website and how the Project Nebula maintainers respond to such
inquiries.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Given that the Project Nebula website is almost entirely static, we think you'll
only never need to contact us via email.

If you notice a service vulnerability detectable in the user-facing portions
of this app, contact the Nebula maintainers at core-maintainers@utdnebula.com
with the subject line `[project-nebula]: User-Facing Security Vulnerability`.

The maintainers will reply to the issue once it is resolved or once a week until
resolution, whichever happens earlier.
